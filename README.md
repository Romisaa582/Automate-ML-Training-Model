## 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning & AutoML
 📌 Overview
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment planning.

This project leverages machine learning and AutoML techniques to analyze medical data and predict whether a patient is at risk of Alzheimer’s disease. By automating model selection, we ensure the best possible accuracy with minimal manual effort.

# 🛠 Features of the Project
✅ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing medical data for analysis.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key trends and patterns in the dataset.
✅ Automated Model Selection: Using LazyPredict to compare multiple classifiers.
✅ Machine Learning Model Training: Identifying the best algorithm for classification.
✅ Interactive Web Application: Built with Streamlit to provide an intuitive user interface.

# 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains key medical indicators used for Alzheimer's prediction, such as:

Age
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Physical Activity Level
Memory Complaints
Forgetfulness
Cognitive and Behavioral Symptoms
Diagnosis (Alzheimer’s or Not)
These features allow us to train a predictive model capable of assessing Alzheimer’s risk based on patient input.

# 🚀 How It Works?
1️⃣ Load Dataset: The system reads the pre-existing dataset directly.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing: Encodes categorical values and handles missing data.
3️⃣ Model Training: Uses LazyPredict to test multiple models.
4️⃣ Performance Evaluation: Selects the best model based on accuracy.
5️⃣ User Interaction: Through the Streamlit interface, users can see dataset insights and trigger model training with a button click.

# 🤖 Machine Learning Approach
To ensure optimal performance, we test multiple classification algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting Models
Instead of manual tuning, we utilize AutoML tools like:

LazyPredict: Automatically trains and compares multiple classifiers.
Train-Test Splitting: Ensures unbiased model evaluation.
By automating model selection, the system identifies the best-performing algorithm without manual intervention.

# 💻 Web Application Interface (Streamlit)
The project includes a Streamlit-powered web app that:
✔ Displays the dataset for quick review.
✔ Shows diagnostic statistics and feature distributions.
✔ Allows users to train a model with one click.
✔ Displays best model accuracy and a comparison of all models.

To run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
# 🔗 Future Enhancements
🚀 Improving Data Quality: Integrating additional medical indicators.
🚀 Deep Learning Models: Experimenting with CNNs & RNNs for enhanced accuracy.
🚀 Real-time Data Integration: Connecting the model to medical databases for live predictions.
🚀 Explainability & Interpretability: Implementing SHAP values for better insights.

# 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of AutoML and machine learning in medical diagnosis. By automating model selection and providing an interactive prediction tool, we aim to contribute to the early detection and improved management of Alzheimer’s disease.
